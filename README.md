# Unit 1 Project - *Flixster - Part 1*

Flixster is an android app that displays 20 movies that are playing now in theaters. Each movie displayed contains the title, movie overview, and movie poster.

Submitted by: **Kevin Kuang**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API. (10 points)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode. (2 points)
* [ ] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Glide). If you're running your app on an emulator, you can change the network speed of the emulator to test this feature by following the guidance here. (1 point)

* [ ] For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed.

## Notes

One of the challenges that I faced was when implementing the MovieAdapter class because I kept having an error saying how there's already a file named MovieAdapter, but in the MainActivity it was not registering the class. It took some time to figure out that the path was not created in the correct file.
